# üå¶Ô∏èRoamCast

**RoamCast** is a React-based web application using modern APIs to transform trip planning into a streamlined experience, combining accurate weather forecasts with AI-driven packing suggestions for travel-ready insights at a glance. Users enter destinations and travel dates; RoamCast then retrieves and summarizes weather data to assist with packing and preparation.

## Features

* **Multi-stop Itinerary**: Add multiple cities with travel dates (up to a 14-day forecast range).
* **Accurate Forecasts**: Retrieve weather forecasts via WeatherAPI.
* **AI-Powered Summaries**: Generate actionable recommendations using the OpenAI API with LangChain integration.
* **Dynamic UI**: Responsive card-based layout for inputs and forecast display.
* **Error Handling**: Inline validation and per-stop error messaging for failed lookups.

## Tech Stack

* **React** with **Vite** for fast frontend development.
* **WeatherAPI** for reliable multi-day weather forecasts.
* **OpenAI API** driven by **LangChain** for natural language summaries.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** for application logic.
* **CSS Variables & Grid** for responsive styling.

## Technical Concepts

* **LangChain**: Manages prompt templates, function calling, and output parsing.
* **Few-Shot Prompting**: Provides examples to guide AI output consistency.
* **Structured Output Parsing**: Converts AI responses into typed JavaScript objects.
* **CSS Grid & Variables**: Achieves responsive, theme-driven design.
* **Error Handling Patterns**: Implements client-side validation and API error capture.
